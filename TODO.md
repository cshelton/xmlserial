To-Do
=====
- [ ] Add support for smart pointers (shared_ptr, unique_ptr, other forms?)
- [ ] Add support for multiple pointers pointing to same spot (need to add "archive" of some form)
- [ ] Use varadic macros to remove the *n versions of the Macros (see my zipfor.h for example)
- [ ] Add more STL containers
