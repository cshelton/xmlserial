To-Do
=====
- [X] Add support for smart pointers (shared_ptr, unique_ptr, other forms?)
- [X] Add support for multiple pointers pointing to same spot (need to add "archive" of some form)
- [ ] Add more STL containers
- [ ] Remove need for 0-arg constructor (caution: std::enable_shared_from_this)
- [ ] Factor out load/save code to allow for other types of archives
- [ ] Add C++11-friendly features (if compiling under C++11)
- [ ] Add support for c-style arrays
